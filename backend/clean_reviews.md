## Going big on design and durability, Motorola’s mid-ranger does come up short in other areas.

Snapchat The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is currently priced from Rs. 22,999 in India
  * Motorola’s Edge 50 Fusion has an attractive and slim IP-rated design 
  * Performance is good for casual use and playing 3D games 
  * Battery life is a bit below expectationsMotorola has diversified its Edge 50 series quite a bit this year compared to last year's Edge 40 series. The company first launched its Edge 50 Pro (from Rs. 29,999), which was then followed by the launch of the Edge 50 Fusion (Rs. 22,999). Recently, it its Edge 50, which, at Rs. 27,999, seems to offer good value as well. Out of the three, the Edge 50 Pro is an easy high-end mid-range recommendation, provided you have the budget to spare. Sitting at the very bottom of the Edge 50 series is the Edge 50 Fusion. It's not as feature-packed as the other two, so is it still relevant after the launch of the Edge 50? And is it a good pick for those looking to buy their first mid-range smartphone?
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Design: Plenty to choose from
  * Dimensions - 162mm x 73.1mm x 7.9mm
  * Weight - 175g
  * Durability - IP68 (dust and water)The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is the second phone to be launched in India as part of its mid-range Edge 50 series. The mid-range smartphone was launched alongside the premium Edge 50 Ultra. If there's one thing that's common among all smartphones in this series, it's their designs. While Motorola seems to have taken immense care in giving each phone enough individual attention (by going with different materials and textures), they all appear very similar when lined up.
Our Marshmallow Blue's unit's vegan leather back offers plenty of grip
The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion gets the same design treatment as the Edge 50 Pro and the newer Edge 50. There are rounded corners and curved edges with a 3D curved-edge However, as mentioned before, it's available in its own set of finishes. One of these, called Forest Blue, has a basic polycarbonate rear panel. The Hot Pink and Marshmallow Blue finishes come with vegan suede and vegan leather rear panels, respectively.
Whether you place the phone on a table or hold it in your hand while browsing, the vegan leather material (bonded to the rear panel) always ensures a solid grip. I also like how the cameras sit nearly flush with the rest of the rear panel. Motorola also includes a colour-matched, environmentally-friendly translucent case in the box, which can be attached for added protection.
The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion's cameras don't protrude as much as on other smartphones, making for a slim overall appearance
One of the finer points about the Edge 50 Fusion's design is its durability. The phone is IP68-rated for dust and water resistance, so you won't need to worry about it when taking it to the beach or poolside, as it can withstand submersion in sand and fresh water. What it misses out on is the rugged MIL-STD-810H certification which the Edge 50 gets.
While water damage is not usually covered under warranty, Motorola will provide some coverage provided the phone has not exceeded its IP68 claims (mentioned in its ), which is limited to immersion in up to 1.5 metres of fresh water for up to 30 minutes.
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Display: Could have been better
  *   *   * 
The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a 3D curved edge display, which is mainly there for cosmetic reasons as the software does not take advantage of it. It has a slim border all-round that appears slightly thicker at the top and bottom. It gets the job done well in broad daylight with its 1,200 nits of brightness and also comes with Motorola's Aqua Touch feature that works just fine when used with wet hands. PWM/DC dimming is available even though it's just 720Hz.
The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion's curved-edge The Its high refresh rate seems a bit unnecessary keeping in mind that its hardware will rarely allow demanding 3D games anywhere near its peak performance (144Hz) and is so mainly used when browsing through the phone's software interface.
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Software: Nothing new to see
  * Software - Hello UI
  * Version - Android 14
  * Latest security patch - 1 May, 2024Hello UI continues to add more bloatware (native apps) to what still appears to be a very clean and customisable operating system. It's based on Android 14, but this is not the near-stock operating system we know and loved half a decade ago. You do get two preinstalled apps - Facebook and Netflix and these can be uninstalled if not needed. The native weather app shows a lot of ads, which is a first for a mid-range smartphone.
Motorola seems to be adding quite a bit of bloatware on its phones lately
The phone is not as big on AI-enabled features as the we earlier. And most of these ”AI features” like Magic Eraser, Unblur and Best Take come courtesy of Google's apps and are not exclusive to Motorola.
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Performance: Meets expectations
  * Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2
  *   * 
The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion's processor does a good job of keeping up with daily multi-tasking requirements. Apps also remain in memory, so there are fewer app restarts. There's virtually no lag or stuttering when interacting with Hello UI, which should be the case given that this is a mid-range smartphone.
Raw performance is as expected and on par with the competition. This is unless you compare it with the which has a high-end MediaTek Dimensity 8300 Ultra processor, aimed at the gaming crowd.

Audio quality, thanks to Dolby Atmos, sounds loud, clear and immersive. This also works well while playing games.
As for the gaming experience, I found the processor to be capable of running titles like Call of Duty: Mobile (CODM) and Asphalt Legends Unite with no problems with default settings. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion supports a maximum of High graphics and a maximum frame rate in CODM. While playing CODM, the phone does get hot after a short while because it lacks a cooling mechanism (also why it's so slim and light). It heats up even more when using the camera app. But this heat is mainly felt on the ## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Cameras: Needs a lot of work
  * Main camera - 50-megapixel (OIS), f/1.9 aperture, AF
  * Ultra-wide camera - 13-megapixel, f/2.2 aperture, AF
  * Selfie camera - 32-megapixel, f/2.5 aperture, FFI had big expectations from the primary camera, given that it's backed by Sony's newer LYTIA 700C sensor. But the results were far from impressive, given that this is a mid-range device.

Selfies captured in daylight appear sharp and pack plenty of detail but with reddish and oversaturated skin tones. Edge detection is decent as well. Low-light selfies are just about passable with or without activating the auto-screen flash. I also came across some random situations when shooting in daylight where the selfie camera only processed the bright background, leaving the subject in the dark (like a shadow).

Video recordings at 1080p appear a bit too scaled down with low detail and lack basic clarity apart from the clipped highlights. The 4K video, which can only be captured at 30fps, appeared leagues better (at the cost of more space), but again, with a lot of clipped highlights showcasing the lack of decent dynamic range.
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Battery: A bit underwhelming
  *   * Charging rate - 68W
  * Charger in the box - YesWhile 5,000mAh batteries aren't really a problem, we are beginning to see bigger batteries make it into competing smartphones in this segment. Among these is the OnePlus CE 4, which did a phenomenal job in our battery life test, lasting a whopping 32 hours and 21 minutes. Motorola Edge 50 Fusion fares well, but just not as good, managing 24 hours and 24 minutes.

In daily use, the phone managed to last a day and a half with casual use but required to be plugged in at the end of the day with heavy usage. Charging the phone was fairly quick. The packaged charger managed to fully charge the phone in 46 minutes in normal mode and 36 minutes in the faster Charge boost mode.
### Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Verdict
Motorola may have found a good match of style, durability, hardware and software, but it did not spend much time refining it. This is how we have what appears to be an unfinished product which is evidently visible upon launching the camera app or when watching video. Lacklustre camera performance aside, battery life isn't as good as some competitors. The same can be said about its raw performance, which is why we won't see this phone being a hit with the gaming crowd as well.
The Motorola Edge 50 (Rs. 27,999 onwards), on the other hand, goes the extra mile, offering even better durability, wireless charging and a telephoto camera at a slightly higher price tag… on paper. Meanwhile, the (), while treading a thin line, managed to cover more bases and blew us away with its battery life. If you have gaming and raw performance on your mind, the () is a much better choice at the same price point. If all you are looking for is an IP68 rating, then Redmi's Note And this leaves the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion with few takers who value durability and style over substance.

*   * Apple iPhone 16e Review: When You Just Need an iPhone# Apple iPhone 16e Review: When You Just Need an iPhone
## Apple’s modern-day iPhone SE is not a budget phone anymore but will meet the needs of a select few.
Written by , Edited by | Updated: 27 March 2025 13:36 IST 
Snapchat The Apple iPhone 16e is priced from Rs. 59,900 in India for the base 128GB variant
  * The Apple iPhone 16e has a compact design 
  * Its binned A18 processor offers blistering performance 
  * Battery life is good for a compact smartphoneOn the Android side of things, picking a phone is an extremely complicated decision. Unless you are brand-loyal, there are tonnes of features to be accounted for before one arrives at a decision. And this is because they come in all shapes and sizes, with varying hardware configurations and even different software experiences, even though they are all based on Google's Android. On the iIf your old trusty went under a bus, and Apple Care won't cover it officially, you have four new and recent iPhones to choose from. Or, you go down that slippery slope where you need to start weighing the prUntil last month, the and the , along with their Plus-sized counterparts, were the only iPhones to choose from for non-Pro iPhone users. Apple has now introduced a new iPhone model called the iPhone 16e. It's got some new hardware bits inside but comes in an old shell. It also cuts down on features many associate an iPhone with. It's priced from Rs. 59,900 in India (for the base 128GB variant), which is relatively high given the hardware on offer. But after using it for a week, it really made me question — what makes an iPhone today?
## Apple iPhone 16e Design: Notch a good idea!
  * Dimensions - 146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.8mm
  * Weight - 167g
  * Durability - IP68In an age where Android smartphone manufacturers are trying to make the selfie camera disappear (or appear only when needed), Apple has launched a premium iPhone in 2025 with a sink-shaped notch. It's not just the notch but also the thick borders surrounding the The iPhone 16e looks like an iPhone SE (2022/2020), and an iPhone 14 (2022) had a baby.
While this may be a turn-off for many, comparing it with the I earlier made me appreciate the abomination that is Dynamic Island introduced with the series.
I have always felt that Dynamic Island was a step backwards for Apple instead of a step forward. Two years in, Dynamic Island still gets in the way of viewing content, not just on Pro models but even on smaller displays like the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 16, along with their Plus-sized counterparts. Heck, it even expands and contracts, which makes it even more distracting on a smaller display.
The iPhone 16e's thick But one look at the iPhone 16e, and I was instantly sold on how neater and smaller Dynamic Island appears compared to the old notch. At the same time, the notch on the 16e did make me appreciate the “simple life”, where my phone does not need to relay every live activity (from various apps) to me at the top of the Given that this phone is priced between Rs. 59,900 and Rs. 89,900, it is a bit shocking that Apple hasn't bothered to offer any colour options. It hints that if you need some colour in your life, you need to pony up and upgrade to an iPhone 15/16.
An IP68 rating offers good protection against the elements, but do keep in mind that “Liquid damage is not covered under warranty.”
A simple ## Apple iPhone 16e Display: Is 60Hz still “smooth”?
  *   *   * 
Apple fans continue to give in and buy iPhones at abnormally high prices, allowing the company to comfortably gatekeep such features until something exciting shows up for the Pro models. Partially, this could be down to the fact that if you haven't used ProMotion on an iPhone, you will never know what it feels like.
Having used 120Hz displays even on entry-level (sub-Rs. 10,000) Android smartphones, switching to the 60Hz panel did take some getting used to. My mind had to adapt to the slightly choppy frame rate and slightly sluggish responsiveness. I would want to tell you that's it's not a big difference, but it really hard to get your brain cells to work with a 60Hz panel once you have used a 120Hz display.
Did I miss a high-refresh-rate panel? Yes! Did I need it? Not really.
Apart from the slightly choppy appearance, the ## Apple iPhone 16e Software: BAU
  * Software version - i  * Software commitment - 5 yearsAfter experiencing an official demo by Apple in a controlled environment, I was not too convinced about Apple Intelligence and its usefulness when stacked against what Samsung's Galaxy and Google's Pixel smartphones are capable of these days.
The only feature that caught my attention was Visual Intelligence, which can be triggered by the Action Button to learn about your surroundings. Tap the ‘Ask' button to get details about an object in front of you, and it delivers a quick summary using ChatGPT.
Apple's iOn-device processing with Visual Intelligence is only used for summarising text (like on a banner or display), quickly recognising and tagging objects (“this could be a carnation”) and in the Image Playground app for generating cartoon-like imagery but nothing beyond. Slightly complex requests, including content formatting, are usually handled by ChatGPT.
Be it image editing or image generation, Apple sure has a long way to go before it can match up to what the other two smartphone brands are capable of today. And so, even if Apple Intelligence (AI) does come to India (scheduled for an April 2024 release), I still don't see it as being remotely useful or capable.
In short, it's not a factor to base your purchasing decisions on, and news of Apple many AI features to the coming year instead of delivering them this year (as promised last year) is a good enough indicator that it is not ready yet and should not be taken seriously.
As customisable as the Action Button is, those upgrading from the older iPhone models may not find the new button as appealing as the iconic switch
From a feature standpoint, compared to the regular or even the iPhone 15, Dynamic Island and its notifications are the only missing features. The Action Button is the only modern iPhone feature that makes it to the 16e. Users stuck on the abovementioned phones will also get access to Car Crash Detection.
## Apple iPhone 16e Performance: Punches above its weight
  * Processor - Apple A18 (with 4 core GPU), 4.02GHz, 3nm
  *   * 
Performance is an area where the Apple iPhone 16e does shine, both against Android rivals and older iPhones. However, the new chipset isn't identical to the one in the latest iPhone 16. The A18 is a binned chipset with one GPU core disabled, meaning it won't perform as well as the Apple A18 SoC inside the iPhone 16 Plus we last year. I have also included benchmark results from a similarly priced Android competitor in the table below for comparison.
**Benchmarks** | **iPhone 16e** | **iPhone 16 Plus** | **OnePlus 13**  
---|---|---|---  
**Chipset** | **A18 (3nm) Binned** | A18 (3nm) | Snapdragon 8 Elite (3nm)

When using the iPhone 16e as my daily driver, I did not notice any slowdowns or any performance problems. Be it running apps or playing games; the 60Hz Regarding that new Apple C1 modem, I did not notice any real-world differences when using the iPhone 16e out and about in Mumbai on Jio's 5G network. Even at crowded conferences, I faced no connectivity issues. And so, I can conclude that Apple's C1 modem does perform as expected, which is impressive given this is its first go at it.
The audio quality is pretty good too. The loudspeakers deliver rich audio quality with good balance, making for an immersive experience while streaming video or playing games.
## Apple iPhone 16e Cameras: A bit below the mark
  * Primary camera - 48-megapixel, f/1.6 aperture, OIS, AF
  * Selfie camera - 12-megapixel, f/1.9 aperture, AFCompared to most smartphones at this price point, Apple has given its iPhone 16e just one rear-facing camera. This camera is also in charge of digital zoom duties, as the viewfinder also shows a default 2X magnification level apart from the standard 1X. Since some of Apple's camera features rely on more than one rear camera, you will find a few usual features missing if you own or have owned a recent iPhone model with two rear cameras.
The camera app lacks Cinematic Video, which lets one add a shallow depth-of-field effect to videos. While this wasn't a deal breaker for me, the lack of a proper Portrait mode is. You see, the iPhone 16e's single camera system instantly reminded me of the (from 2018), as its Portrait mode only works on human subjects and nothing else. Indeed, I was expecting some AI (Apple Intelligence) magic to help out here. But clearly this isn't the case.
Need an ultra-wide camera? You will have to take several steps back
Another detail to keep in mind is that Apple has not used the primary camera from the new iPhone 16, the iPhone 15, or the iPhone 14 before it. This primary camera even lacks Apple's sensor-shift tech and goes with a more basic lens-based OIS system instead.
Apple iPhone 16e primary camera samples 
PhotThe capture frame of the 1X primary camera also feels a bit constrained and not wide enough. Apple should have gone with a wider lens, given that this phone has no dedicated ultra-wide camera either.

It's business as usual for the selfie camera. Decent photVideo quality is more Android-like, in the sense that even at 4K 30 fps, it's not as smooth as one would expect from a modern-day iPhone 15 or 16. Thankfully, the colours and dynamic range are accurate, but the overall clarity is lacking. Low-light video quality is blurry and quite noisy, and it appears soft in general.
## Apple iPhone 16e Battery: Impressive
  *   * Wired charging - Around 18-20W
  * Wireless charging - 7.5W
  * Charger in box - NoApple's marketing strategy for the heavily emphasises battery life. Apple states that a lot of this is down to the use of a larger battery (because there's just one camera). Apple also states that its C1 modem is much more efficient than the one used in an iPhone 15. All of the above, combined with the A18 processor and a standard 60Hz refresh-rate display, should deliver some impressive battery figures.
Everyone's smartphone usage differs and, so it's hard to give an estimate of battery life. However, there was a day when I covered a conference shooting about 70 1080p video clips (about 30-60 seconds long) along with 5G uploads for 70 percent of them, and my phone had drained to 50 percent by noon, which is very good. More so for a compact smartphone!
In our HD video loop test, which keeps running a video file in a loop until the battery runs out, the iPhone 16e managed 21 hours and 50 minutes, which isn't the best we have seen at this price point. Even Google's , with a (not so efficient) Tensor G4 inside, managed a slightly better 25 hours and 6 minutes. Meanwhile, the we tested managed a 27 hours and 20 minutes.
The best way to charge an iPhone 16e
Apple has not released any official figures, so I plugged it into a 100W GaN charger (which also supports PD) to see what this compact phone is capable of. The iPhone 16e delivered an impressive 58 percent charge in 30 minutes but then slowed down, managing 86 percent in 60 minutes. The device completed the charge in 1 hour and 34 minutes, which is still faster than the iPhone 16 Plus we tested earlier, but disappointingly slow compared to most Android devices available at this price point.
### Apple iPhone 16e Verdict
Reviewing the iPhone 16e indeed got me thinking about what an iPhone experience really stands for today.
  * Do you need a ProMotion display?
  * Do you need the latest processor?
  * Do you need fast wireless charging?
  * Do you need a capable set of cameras?
  * And do you need MagSafe and all of its accessories?Indeed, your personal requirements will see you picking or ignoring the iPhone 16e. I could tolerate the 60Hz display, the slower charging and everything else, but the camera was indeed the deal breaker for me, especially considering this phone's price tag.
The elephant in the room is (). It sells at around the same price as iPhone 16e during festive sales and, so it makes little sense to pick up an iPhone 16e unless you prioritise battery life and nothing else.
And that leaves the iPhone 16e for the “I just need an iPhone crowd”. Those who aren't bothered by AI and are fine with decent camera quality. These are users who aren't aware, haven't experienced and don't care about MagSafe and Dynamic Island.
Those who are still using an iPhone SE (2020/), the iPhone 7 series or an iPhone 8 series and are on a tight budget, can also comfortably upgrade to the 16e. They will be more than happy to embrace features like USB-C charging, 5G connectivity and Car Crash Detection. They will also experience better battery life and slightly better cameras versus what they have been using on their older devices.

Snapchat The Nothing Phone 3a is priced from Rs. 24,999 for the 8GB + 128GB variant in India
  * The Phone 3a offers better build quality with improved durability 
  * It’s software experience is both intuitive and impressive 
  * Despite its standard capacity, battery life is reliableAs of 2025, there are just a few smartphone brands that care about creative design. Gone are the days of refreshing and outlandish Nokia feature phone and smartphone designs that never failed to amaze us with their weird and wacky shapes and form factors. What excited me back then were the new and experimental designs (N-gage, Nokia 7600), where the focus was more on the experience and just doing something differently. Lately, Apple has single-handedly managed to turn every smartphone into a slab with two sheets of glass.
Even the most expensive foldables from premium brands appear like boring glass slabs. Apple's iNothing as a brand stands out in this sea of, well, nothings (at least from a design standpoint). With a product philosophy based on design, it takes those gutsy decisions that big-name brands are too afraid to take, paving a path for a refreshing series of products that not only dare to appear different (in a tasteful manner) but also strive to remain that way several years into the game. With the latest , it's evidently clear that its formula works and how!
## Nothing Phone 3a Design: Notable improvements
  * Dimensions - 163.5 x 77.5 x 8.3mm
  * Weight - 201g
  * Durability - IP64The nostalgic and futuristic design philosophy between the Nothing Phone 2a and the new Phone 3a remains the same. It does not take too much effort to spot similarities between the two. The part at the top right corner, which is now made of metal, and the red square were also present on the .
Also obvious is that most of the design effort has gone into the new Phone 3a Pro model, which gets a better 3X telephoto camera instead of the 2X unit on the Phone 3a.
Compared to the , the Phone 3a gets a new colour option called Blue. However, we received the standard White model for review.
Despite its design similarities with the Phone 2a, the 3a's rear panel is now made of glass instead of plastic. It no longer is a dust magnet, and we barely noticed any fingerprints on the White unit we received.
Alongside the usual power button is also a new Essential Key, which I will go into detail about in the software section of this review.
The phone's frame is made of polycarbonate and surely reminded us of the old and the Nokia Lumias ( and ) because of its soft matte finish. The glass back has helped bump up the Phone 3a's water and dust resistance to an IP64 rating, which is not much to talk about but is good to have. It's good for splashes or sprays of water but not immersion. Like most manufacturers, it's highly recommended to avoid this as much as possible, as damage due to water ingress is not covered under warranty.
The design of the Nothing Phone 3a isn't fresh going by the company's standards, but it surely stands out when placed alongside similarly priced smartphones from the mid-range with their done-and-dusted glass, faux leather or textured rear panels. Such levels of creativity are not even found in the premium segment.
I observed a few assembly issues that might be specific to my review unit.
Thankfully, these are down to the bits that go under the glass rear panel. The shiny metal part (as seen in the above image) at the top right corner is misaligned by a millimetre, as it seems to be rotated in the clockwise direction. The red box is also misaligned by very little but tilts in the opposite anticlockwise direction. We hope that future batches will address these issues.
## Nothing Phone 3a Display: Excellent for its price
  *   *   * Protection - Panda GlassThe Nothing Phone 3a has a While impressive, the Nothing Phone 3a's AMOLED Colours are a tad bit saturated in the Alive mode for screen colour but appear natural with the Standard mode. My only problem with it is that it lacks an HDR10 or HDR10+ certification for video streaming, which is available on some competing smartphones in India.
## Nothing Phone 3a Software: More art than smartphone UI
  * Software version - Nothing   * Android version - Android 15
  * Software commitment - 3 years of software, 6 years of security updatesUnlike most smartphone interfaces that feel like they have been designed for mass consumption and appeal, Nothing The widgets on the home screen have also been given their fair share of attention.
I absolutely dig the Date widget, which simply displays the current date with a bold font. The entertaining bit is that you get a tiny page folded in its bottom right corner every day, forcing you to swipe up the page and reveal the current day's date (along with agenda items). It's this minute attention to detail (even if it is manual) that made me notice and remember the current date.
The Do Not Disturb widget turns into a bold red when activated and stands out from the rest of the interface when active. The compass widget with a tap wakes up to point north like every good compass should. I just wished that it woke up with the phone and remained that way for a few seconds.
There is a fun News Reporter widget (which looks like an old radio speaker) that, upon tapping, wakes up and starts reading out the news (as per your preferences). Each bar of its speaker-like design goes from red to grey as the news is being read out. So, even if you pause it, you will know how many more hand-picked news items remain to be read out. The news selection and voice seem to be AI-generated or at least read out by a pre-defined AI-like voice. There's even a page-turning sound after each byte, giving it a very old-school feel.
Coming to the basics, there's a new Inter font, that can be used as the system font. This means that Inter will be forced in every third-party app that does not use its special font, making the UI and And there are a few things that Nothing Nothing on Last but definitely not least is Nothing's take on artificial intelligence (AI). Nothing executives keep speaking about how they want to do AI differently compared to being a content formatting tool or a meeting summariser, transcribing and the usual image editing/generation that everyone (including Apple) else has done to death (with or without success). Nothing's take on AI is Essential Space, which could have something to do with Andy Rubin's startup, absorbed by Nothing back in 2021.
When I started using Essential Space, I assumed it was just another attempt to push AI in your face. But the Essential Key (a physical button on the left side) made me curious enough to give it a shot.
Pressing down the Essential Key once takes a screenshot of what's on your display, and then you are prompted to add typed notes about your current thought or press the record button for a voice note. Once recorded, press it once again to stop recording and then once again to save to Essential Space.
The intriguing part is how Essential Space digests and preps this data for recall. Currently, everything functions through the use of screenshots, but there are plans to integrate the camera with Essential Key to extract information from your surroundings for recall. There's also a focused mode planned for future release that will let you record an entire meeting. After this, the tool will not only recognise speakers and transcribe information; it will also create to-dThe only downside of Essential Space is that you cannot take away your data. Hopefully, in the future, all of the data gathered by this feature will be available in files and folders backed up to the cloud, which can then be offloaded onto another ## Nothing Phone 3a Performance: Great, but far from the best
  * Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, 2.5GHz, 4nm
  *   * 
Everyday software performance is pretty smooth despite Nothing's rather controversial use of UFS 2.2 storage. The adaptive Gaming performance was good, as I managed to run Call of Duty: Mobile at Very High graphics and frame rate. The display's touch sampling rate of 480Hz, which is only available in Game Mode, seemed just about sufficient. I've experienced better touch sensitivity, especially while playing games on competing devices.
The vapour chamber cooling system sure does its job of maintaining the phone's performance under stress
The phone warms up while playing games and gets hot when using the camera app outdoors; however, the camera app does not shut down nor show any warnings about limiting use. Indeed, the vapour cooling system was doing its job. However, the phone always struggled with processing images (it takes a second or two after capture), which is something I also noticed on the Realme P3 Pro (has the same chip). I also noticed some sluggishness when using the camera app, especially when switching between camera modes or switching cameras.
As far as benchmarks go, the Nothing Phone 3a performs as expected, as can be seen from the table below.

## Nothing Phone 3a Cameras: Well above average
  * Primary camera - 50-megapixel, OIS, f/1.5 aperture, AF
  * Ultrawide camera - 8-megapixel, f/2.2 aperture, FF
  * Telephoto camera - 50-megapixel, 2X, EIS, f/2.0 aperture, AF
  * Selfie camera - 32-megapixel, f/2.2 aperture, FF _Note: Our camera samples and observations are based on the latest software update (received around March 10), and it brought about some drastic camera improvements versus the previous update the phone was tested with. The update (Asteroids-V3.1-250302-1856-IND) also added several new features, including the ability to create and share new camera filters/presets mentioned below._
Nothing brought the widest selection of cameras available in this segment or price point. While most smartphones pack a wide + ultra-wide combination, Nothing has managed a 2X telephoto camera, which is an interesting addition given the price point.
In a recent update, Nothing even added the ability to create, share or import someone else's custom preset (via cube files), which is unique and could become popular in the Nothing community.
Another intriguing feature I like is the presets that can be applied when shooting. These presets are not just colour, hue, or saturation adjustments; they also define which camera mode (even video) and what magnification can be used when selected. You can also add advanced settings, like keeping the flash on, image quality (binned or full resolution), and even turning the grid on or off, which is brilliant! You can pin these presets to your home screen as a widget and launch directly into a particular custom preset.
Nothing Phone 3a ultrawide camera samples 
Coming to the cameras, the ultra-wide camera is the weakest one of the three, but it is by no means bad. It offers decent performance for its price point, producing photNothing Phone 3a primary camera samples 
The primary camera is indeed the best and most capable of the three. Unlike the Nothing Phone 3a, it's the only one with optical image stabilisation (OIS). Photographs captured in all shooting scenariNothing Phone 3a 2X telephoto camera samples 
The telephoto camera feeds on light. The colours it produces are a bit more saturated than the primary camera's; it also adds a bit of sharpening to images, which can appear excessive when shooting portrait photos. Provided there's good light, you get plenty of detail, and some crispy captures with good natural bokeh. The accuracy of edge detection varies depending on the complexity of your subject's hairstyle.
You begin to notice a drop in image quality under artificial light or when shooting against a source of light. When using portrait mode, the camera tries its best, but the absence of OIS does not allow it to pick up enough details from faces. Your subjects will also need to be perfectly still in such lighting conditions.
The telephoto camera performs better when not using the dedicated Portrait mode. 4X lossless samples are usable, but you will notice a drop in detail when you pixel peep. Despite its daylight capabilities, those who plan to use Portrait Mode often are indeed better off with the 's 3X telephoto camera, which is optically stabilised.
Selfies pack good detail and accurate edge detection in daylight but come out average in low light 
Video recordings are indeed an area that Nothing needs to work on. For a low-end, mid-range smartphone, it meets expectations by offering good stabilisation and decent detail when shooting video at 1080p and 4K. However, this only applies when shooting in broad daylight, as low-light video capture is quite poor.
Consistency in terms of colour reproduction between the three cameras is something Nothing still needs to work on. Of course, we're discussing a Rs. 25,000 phone, but it would be great if Nothing could figure it out with future updates. All camera samples were clicked with the Auto-tone feature turned off, as it just added unnecessary colour saturation.
## Nothing Phone 3a Battery:
  *   * Wired charging - 50W
  * Charger in the box - NoDespite having a slightly smaller battery than most competing smartphones, nothing has managed to squeeze the most out of it, thanks to good software optimisation. While the phone lasted me a whole day and a bit longer with heavy usage (calls, messaging, camera usage, and a bit of gaming), it managed a good score of 28 hours and 37 minutes, which is better than what the Realme P3 Pro' manages with a higher-capacity battery.
Our PCMark Work battery test, which replicates regular smartphone usage scenarios, running the battery down to 20 percent, lasted a solid 17 hours and 40 minutes of continuous usage. Again, the figure is a bit surprising, as the Realme P3 Pro, with the same chipset, an AMOLED display, and a larger 6,000mAh battery, managed 10 minutes less.
Charging speeds are relatively slow at 50W, given that most phones in this segment offer better. In our testing, we managed to charge the Nothing Phone 3a to 46 percent in 30 minutes and complete the charging process in 1 hour and 26 minutes when plugged into a 100W GaN charger. For comparison, Realme's P3 Pro charged a bigger 6,000mAh battery in 1 hour and 6 minutes.
### Nothing Phone 3a Verdict
With its focus on design and balanced hardware choices, Nothing certainly has come up with a winner in the mid-range (budget in global markets). It beautifully combines hardware, cosmetic design, and software. And it's even more applause-worthy, given that so much effort has been put into a low-end mid-ranger!
That said, the new camera hardware is an upgrade over the previous model. While it works alright, Nothing should work on delivering more camera updates to improve its performance even further.
Indeed, there are better performance-oriented alternatives like the (), and spec-heavy options like the () and the recently launched "flagship killer" () in India. But when it comes to design and software execution, Nothing's Phone 3a is a phone I can pick up and use when I get bored of other smartphones. It has the software that I want to use on every Android smartphone.

## The OnePlus 13 is a brand-new smartphone from the ground up, but is new always better?
Written by , Edited by | Updated: 7 January 2025 21:54 IST 
Snapchat The OnePlus 13 is priced from Rs. 69,999 in India for the 12GB + 256GB variant
  * The OnePlus 13 has new design with a modular twist 
  * There’s plenty of new AI-enabled features 
  * Camera performance is impressiveOnePlus ended 2024 with some really interesting announcements. It wasn't the best year for the BBK-owned brand in India, but after getting by a large group of mobile retailers, the company decided to turn things around by going with an internal rejig. After this, it attempted to end the year on a good note by announcing a fresh new direction for the brand. OnePlus decided to tackle the mammoth task of recurring display-related , which have plagued the brand's handsets for years. It also that it has not only worked on fixing the problem with upcoming devices but would also provide a lifetime replacement warranty for all of its smartphone models. Also introduced was , a part of OnePlus' efforts to overhaul its customer service experience in India.
With underlying issues now swept clean, OnePlus has finally announced its all-new . It is the successor to the , which was a proper all-rounder in our . The OnePlus 13 is a brand-new device with a new design direction, packs AI software tricks and loads of raw performance and battery life. Like the , which received a new Quick Button and magnetic cases, OnePlus also got to pick a new feature from the BBK bin, and it decided to add magnetic wireless charging. It is similar to what Oppo offers via the same magnetic cases, which were silently launched in India last year for obvious reasons. After testing out the phone for weeks, I must say that the OnePlus 13 has to be one of the most ambitious smartphones from the brand to date.
## OnePlus 13 Design: Slimmer and... modular?
  * Dimensions - 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5mm
  * Weight - 213g
  * Durability - IP68 + IP69I received the OnePlus 13 in the new Arctic Dawn finish, the most basic among the three. The black colourway called Black Eclipse is reserved for the most high-end The OnePlus 13 has IP68 + IP69 certification for dust and water resistance
Despite receiving the most basic colourway, I am impressed as to how OnePlus has managed to make a slimmer device (compared to the OnePlus 12) with a higher capacity battery while improving its IP rating and maintaining its fast wireless charging tech.
The OnePlus 13's design does appear a bit familiar to but feels a bit lighter. Thanks to its mirror-finish aluminium frame and flat sides, it offers more grip than the latter. While the frame (chassis) has flat sides, the rear and front panels have also been flattened (compared to the rounded OnePlus 12) with curved edges that seamlessly merge with the frame.
The phone's water and dust resistance has received a solid upgrade this year and is now IP69-certified, meaning that it can even withstand pressured jets of hot water (like in a car wash). Given that OnePlus offers protection plans for its devices at an additional cost, you can confidently immerse this device in freshwater.
The new OnePlus AIRVOOC 50W Magnetic Charger is not your average wireless charger
The modular part starts with the phone's case. OnePlus has launched many accessories in India, including a couple of phone cases with a built-in magnetic ring that holds the new accessories in place. This short list of magnetic accessories includes a magnetic snap-on charger and a 5,000mAh magnetic power bank.
The OnePlus AIRVOOC 50W Magnetic Charger may seem like an Apple MagSafe charger, but in principle, it works in a very different manner. Unlike Qi and Qi 2 chargers available in the market offered by smartphone brands, OnePlus takes things a step further by adding a thermoelectric (peltier) chip inside the charger. This peltier effect chip aims to keep the charging process cool, which, according to OnePlus, also reduces battery degradation commonly caused by heat, which is a by-product of wireless charging.
The fan, along with the thermoelectric chip, can dissipate heat while keeping the area with the magnetic flux and contact surfaces cool. However, the true capability of the cooling chip is not utilised to the fullest because the cooled surface of the charger does not make direct contact with the phone but the plastic case instead. And since the phone is well insulated from the cold contact patch of the wireless charger, it cannot be used as a cooling solution while playing games. OnePlus' Freezing Point Phone Cooler is a better accessory for gamers as it directly clips onto the phone's rear panel.
The wireless charger has a strong magnetic force, enough to suspend the phone from a charging socket
Indeed, the charger's magnetic grip possesses a powerful 'death grip', allowing the phone to be suspended from a wall outlet. Out of curiosity, I even snapped it onto an iPhone 15 Pro Max. The device firmly attached itself to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, securely holding the charger in place and keeping the iPhone ice-cold throughout the charging process. It's just that the charging process was quite slow compared to OnePlus' AIRVOOC speeds.
The magnetic charger accessory is a great idea that combines the two existing technologies in the best possible way. I just wish that the magnets to hold the accessories were built into the rear panel instead of the case.
## OnePlus 13 Display: As good as it gets
  *   *   * 
From a design standpoint, this is the first OnePlus device (save for the ‘R'-branded models) to have a flat display. While its border appears slimmer when holding the phone front and centre, the curved protective glass around the corners makes it appear thicker when viewed from any other angle. While the curved edge displays on the previous models did not have any specific purpose apart from lending the device a premium look, the same applies to the new quad-curved glass, which, apart from its appearance, serves no other purpose. However, just like on the , I did find the reflections due to its quad-curved edges quite distracting when viewed outdoors.
The quad-curved protective glass screen shows a lot of distracting reflections outdoors
The ## OnePlus 13 Software: Jack of all trades...
  * Software version - Android 15
  * Software - Oxygen  * Software commitment - 4 years of software, 6 years of security updatesI have already explored most of the features offered by ColorOnePlus' algorithms still require some fine-tuning to be as capable as Google's Pixel devices. At the moment, the bulk of image editing tools, such as the AI Eraser and AI Reflection Eraser tools, are capable in the sense that they may or may not produce the desired outcomes.
OxygenOnePlus's new Intelligent Search is available on the OnePlus 13. However, basic search keyword-related results aside, it honestly can't do much. It cannot even find files in the documents apps (both Google Files and OnePlus Files), even after typing in the exact file name, which is a bit strange.
Live Translation promises to provide real-time translation across 20 languages, but the feature will arrive at a later date. So I could not test it out.
The AI-based image editing tools sure need a lot of work
Open Canvas which in 2023 and is still one of the best multitasking features on the . After the , it finally arrives as a regular bar-shaped smartphone. It works in a familiar manner, letting you open two apps at a time, like in split screen mode, but lets you stretch the window of one app (by about 80 percent), letting the second app peak from the top or bottom. If you need to switch, simply tap the other app to start using it! While it may not sound like a big deal, it reduces the need to keep adjusting the divider between two apps in split-screen mode. It also lets you see more of the app that you are working on compared to the regular split-screen implementation.
Open Canvas is a fun way to multitask, letting you view more of the primary app in a split-screen arrangement
Just like on the Find X8 Pro, I do like the AI Summary and AI Speak features that are available via the Smart Sidebar. AI Reply also provides well-written contextual replies, but only for select apps.
Seeing how far OnePlus has gotten since the OnePlus 12 is interesting. You also need to keep in mind that Google's Gemini Live and Assistant are available on this phone, which basically fills the void left behind by the lack of OnePlus' own dedicated virtual assistant. In many aspects, I think this is a good initiative. However, users need to read through the fine print and be aware of where their personal data is shared, as some AI features use OnePlus' (AKA ColorOS') AI model, while others use Google's AI models.
## OnePlus 13 Performance: Impressive
  * Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, 4.32GHz, 3nm

Apps also stay in memory for a considerable amount of time, and the software operates with a smooth and seamless feel.

The gaming performance is impressive. The phone managed to stick to a solid 60 fps while playing Genshin Impact at its highest preset at 60 fps. However, I was a bit surprised to see no MEMC or Adaptive Frame Booster support for the same title, as it was available on the Oppo Find X8 series.
Oppo's BeaconLink, a feature introduced with the and the , is also available on the OnePlus 13. However, I could not test it out as I did not have a second compatible device.
## OnePlus 13 Cameras: New does not mean better
  * Primary camera - 50-megapixel, f/1.6, OIS
  * Telephoto camera - 50-megapixel, f/2.65, OIS
  * Ultrawide camera - 50-megapixel, f/2.05, AF
  * Selfie camera - 50-megapixel, f/2.45, FFOnePlus's new Triprism telephoto camera takes up a lot less space compared to a regular periscope telephoto camera
OnePlus has retained the primary and selfie cameras from the previous model. As for the upgrades, it has switched from the 64-megapixel OmniVision OV64B periscope telephoto camera to a new Sony LYT-600, which still offers 3X optical zoom but in a lighter and more compact package thanks to its triprism layout. The ultrawide camera has also been changed, with the 48-megapixel Sony IMX581 replaced by an improved S5KJN5 camera with a 50-megapixel sensor.
_While testing out the cameras on the OnePlus 13, I was also a bit interested as to how it compared to the previous OnePlus 12. So, I have included comparisons between the two below for reference._
OnePlus 13 primary camera samples 
The primary camera produces sharp photThe new trisprism camera performs well at 3X (top) and 6X (bottom) magnification 
The 3X triprism telephoto camera is quite the sharpshooter. In fact, even the lossless 6X magnification images it produces are excellent in terms of detail. While its capabilities are commendable in low light, the photThe 6x lossless telephoto image captured by the OnePlus 12 (bottom) appears a lot sharper and detailed compared to the OnePlus 13's image (top) 
The ultrawide camera is a nice upgrade to the previous model. It keeps the barrel distortion under control while maintaining enough detail. This also applies to low-light shooting, which produces clean images with little noise.
In terms of colour processing, every camera seems to want to do its own thing, as can be seen from the collage above. However, shot-to-shot consistency when using the same camera is good and dependable. If you need to get more accurate colours, it's best to switch to OnePlus' Master mode.
AI Zoom OFF (Top), AI Zoom ON (bottom) 
As for Zoom, just like the Find X8 Pro, the OnePlus 13 activates AI Zoom once you reach 60X. The outcomes are unpredictable and rely on the creativity of the AI model. I found the images captured till 10X to be usable, beyond which the image quality noticeably deteriorates.

Selfies captured in daylight appeared sharp and crisp with good edge detection, while low-light captures remain the same as before, which is a bit soft.

  *   * Wired charging - 100W
  * Wireless charging - 50WThe 50W AIRVOOC charger is easily one of the fastest wireless charging solutions available in India. And is way faster than the usual Qi or Qi 2 speeds available for most Android smartphones. In fact, it can defeat the wired charging speeds of most premium flagships from Apple and Samsung and keep the charger and surfaces cool while doing so.
The new silicon carbon battery, despite its 6,000mAh capacity, can easily fit into the OnePlus 13's slim body
In our testing, the 50W AIRVOOC Magnetic Charger fully charged the phone's 6,000mAh battery in 1 hour and 15 minutes. The wired SUPERVOOC 100W charger managed a 55% charge in 15 minutes and completed the charging process (fully charged) in 41 minutes.
As for battery life, the OnePlus 13 lasted 26 hours and 2 minutes in our video battery loop test. While usage patterns vary from person to person, the phone easily lasted me a day and a half with casual use (calls, social media apps, email and office apps) and a little over a day with heavy use (gaming and camera), which is pretty impressive.
### OnePlus 13 Verdict
OnePlus appears to be seeking a fresh start, and the OnePlus 13 represents a significant advancement. It's got a ton of upgrades in every department, including AI tricks and some new toys.
Priced from Rs. 69,999 onwards (12GB + 256GB), the once again makes a case for itself in the sub-Rs. 70,000 segment. It is possible to find many smartphones (like the and ) that offer similar performance at a lower price, but none can match the camera prowess of the OnePlus 13 at this price point.Those interested in a smaller form factor can give the a look, as it, is packed with but falls short on camera performance. users who are looking for something more powerful will still find the OnePlus 13 enticing even though the camera upgrades are qualitative.
Given Samsung's lack of interest in improving their Galaxy S series' camera capabilities (the retains the camera hardware from the S22), the OnePlus 13 presents a compelling alternative for those seeking a more comprehensive camera experience. Add to this the new design options, magnetic accessories, fast charging, big battery upgrades and OnePlus' extended warranty program, and it's hard to look elsewhere.
                        * Slim IP68 and IP69-rated design

The phone is the latest arrival in the highly competitive budget segment in India, where most smartphones are equipped with OLED screens, support 5G connectivity, and offer fast charging support. We've spent a few days with this smartphone to find out whether it offers enough to stand out in this segment.

## OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite Review: Design
The ‘Mega Blue' colour variant of the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite has a plastic rear panel, and flat plastic edges that have a metal-like finish. The corners of the phone are slightly rounded and the flat edges help you get a comfortable grip. The handset feels slightly heavy, even without the included TPU case — it weighs 191g — but not enough to cause fatigue while using it.
The smooth rear panel is reflective and doesn't attract too many fingerprints or smudges
Like its predecessor, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite has a vertically aligned The bottom edge of the Nord CE 4 Lite houses a 3.5mm audio jack, a microphone, a USB Type-C port and a speaker grille.

The Snapdragon 695 is a decent smartphone chip for ordinary tasks, and offers similar performance as its competitors that run on MediaTek's Dimensity 7050 chipset. It can run some popular games and several widely used apps, as long as they're not too demanding.
OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite benchmark results 
The Nord CE 4 Lite processes the colour of the sky differently in 1x and 2x modes 
The camera app also offers an in-sensor zoom mode which lets you capture images at 2x zoom. mode and the feature lets you capture detailed images of subjects that are close by. However, just like the default 1x mode, you'll notice a lack of detail when you zoom in on pictures.
The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite also comes with a dedicated Night mode, for shooting images in low light conditions. My biggest gripe with the camera app is that you need to manually enable the night mode — it won't automatically apply any enhancements when it detects a dark scenario.
When enabled, the night mode does deliver better results in terms of visibility and there's a little more detail compared to images shot in auto mode. However, it takes a little over a second to capture each image, which means that you can't use it to capture images of moving subjects. There's also a lot of smoothening to get rid of noise, and it also tends to make the sky appear much brighter than it actually is at night, which isn't ideal.
The night mode on the Nord CE 4 Lite improves images in low light scenariNight mode shots captured on the Nord CE 4 Lite have a considerable amount of smoothening 
OnePlus has equipped the Nord CE 4 Lite with a 16-megapixel primary camera, which is good at capturing selfies while outdoors during the day — or even when indoors, assuming you have enough light around. However, images captured during the night are blurry and colours appear a little less vibrant.

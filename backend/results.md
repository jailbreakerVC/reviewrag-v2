The Nothing Phone 3a is priced from Rs. 24,999 for the 8GB + 128GB variant in India
Highlights
  * The Phone 3a offers better build quality with improved durability
  * It’s software experience is both intuitive and impressive
  * Despite its standard capacity, battery life is reliable


As of 2025, there are just a few smartphone brands that care about creative design. Gone are the days of refreshing and outlandish Nokia feature phone and smartphone designs that never failed to amaze us with their weird and wacky shapes and form factors. What excited me back then were the new and experimental designs (N-gage, Nokia 7600), where the focus was more on the experience and just doing something differently. Lately, Apple has single-handedly managed to turn every smartphone into a slab with two sheets of glass.
Even the most expensive foldables from premium brands appear like boring glass slabs. Apple's iOS and Google's Android may have paved the way for what seems to be an ideal software ecosystem. But we are now stuck with a bunch of boring icons, predictable animations, and transitions that feel far too basic. Clearly, they aren't built to amaze us anymore; they simply exist to deliver and serve a bunch of apps.
Nothing as a brand stands out in this sea of, well, nothings (at least from a design standpoint). With a product philosophy based on design, it takes those gutsy decisions that big-name brands are too afraid to take, paving a path for a refreshing series of products that not only dare to appear different (in a tasteful manner) but also strive to remain that way several years into the game. With the latest , it's evidently clear that its formula works and how!
## Nothing Phone 3a Design: Notable improvements
  * Dimensions - 163.5 x 77.5 x 8.3mm
  * Weight - 201g
  * Durability - IP64


The nostalgic and futuristic design philosophy between the Nothing Phone 2a and the new Phone 3a remains the same. It does not take too much effort to spot similarities between the two. The part at the top right corner, which is now made of metal, and the red square were also present on the .
Also obvious is that most of the design effort has gone into the new Phone 3a Pro model, which gets a better 3X telephoto camera instead of the 2X unit on the Phone 3a.
Compared to the , the Phone 3a gets a new colour option called Blue. However, we received the standard White model for review.
Despite its design similarities with the Phone 2a, the 3a's rear panel is now made of glass instead of plastic. It no longer is a dust magnet, and we barely noticed any fingerprints on the White unit we received.
Alongside the usual power button is also a new Essential Key, which I will go into detail about in the software section of this review.
The phone's frame is made of polycarbonate and surely reminded us of the old and the Nokia Lumias ( and ) because of its soft matte finish. The glass back has helped bump up the Phone 3a's water and dust resistance to an IP64 rating, which is not much to talk about but is good to have. It's good for splashes or sprays of water but not immersion. Like most manufacturers, it's highly recommended to avoid this as much as possible, as damage due to water ingress is not covered under warranty.
The design of the Nothing Phone 3a isn't fresh going by the company's standards, but it surely stands out when placed alongside similarly priced smartphones from the mid-range with their done-and-dusted glass, faux leather or textured rear panels. Such levels of creativity are not even found in the premium segment.
I observed a few assembly issues that might be specific to my review unit.
Thankfully, these are down to the bits that go under the glass rear panel. The shiny metal part (as seen in the above image) at the top right corner is misaligned by a millimetre, as it seems to be rotated in the clockwise direction. The red box is also misaligned by very little but tilts in the opposite anticlockwise direction. We hope that future batches will address these issues.
## Nothing Phone 3a Display: Excellent for its price
  * Display size - 6.77-inch, 1,080 x 2,392 pixels, Full-HD+ (387 PPI)
  * Display type - AMOLED, 60-90-120Hz
  * Protection - Panda Glass


The Nothing Phone 3a has a display that is similar to that of the previous Phone 2a. It also has the same 120Hz refresh rate. It offers 1,300 nits of maximum brightness and 3,000 nits of peak brightness, which makes outdoor use problem-free. The display glass and the flexible AMOLED panel are both flat, which means you get excellent viewing angles minus the unnecessary reflections available on some competing models that offer quad-curved displays.
While impressive, the Nothing Phone 3a's AMOLED display lacks HDR10+ certification
Colours are a tad bit saturated in the Alive mode for screen colour but appear natural with the Standard mode. My only problem with it is that it lacks an HDR10 or HDR10+ certification for video streaming, which is available on some competing smartphones in India.
## Nothing Phone 3a Software: More art than smartphone UI
  * Software version - Nothing OS 3.1
  * Android version - Android 15
  * Software commitment - 3 years of software, 6 years of security updates


Unlike most smartphone interfaces that feel like they have been designed for mass consumption and appeal, Nothing OS feels more hand-crafted and unique. It took me a day to recognise the gallery icon (until then, I assumed Google Photos was the default gallery app), but once I found it and placed it on the home screen, I was able to find it instantly all the time.
The widgets on the home screen have also been given their fair share of attention.
I absolutely dig the Date widget, which simply displays the current date with a bold font. The entertaining bit is that you get a tiny page folded in its bottom right corner every day, forcing you to swipe up the page and reveal the current day's date (along with agenda items). It's this minute attention to detail (even if it is manual) that made me notice and remember the current date.
The Do Not Disturb widget turns into a bold red when activated and stands out from the rest of the interface when active. The compass widget with a tap wakes up to point north like every good compass should. I just wished that it woke up with the phone and remained that way for a few seconds.
There is a fun News Reporter widget (which looks like an old radio speaker) that, upon tapping, wakes up and starts reading out the news (as per your preferences). Each bar of its speaker-like design goes from red to grey as the news is being read out. So, even if you pause it, you will know how many more hand-picked news items remain to be read out. The news selection and voice seem to be AI-generated or at least read out by a pre-defined AI-like voice. There's even a page-turning sound after each byte, giving it a very old-school feel.
Coming to the basics, there's a new Inter font, that can be used as the system font. This means that Inter will be forced in every third-party app that does not use its special font, making the UI and OS appear more consistent. Inter, just like the other fonts used in Nothing OS, somehow gel very well together.
And there are a few things that Nothing OS does a bit differently. The lock screen can have up to 4 widgets, which are scrollable once you lift the phone.
Nothing on OS has one of the coolest lock screens I have laid eyes on in recent times, and it is also shockingly customisable. However, tapping on a notification here will take you directly to the notifications tray. I initially didn't like it (it's not normal for Android phones), but I somehow got used to it a few days into the testing process.
Last but definitely not least is Nothing's take on artificial intelligence (AI). Nothing executives keep speaking about how they want to do AI differently compared to being a content formatting tool or a meeting summariser, transcribing and the usual image editing/generation that everyone (including Apple) else has done to death (with or without success). Nothing's take on AI is Essential Space, which could have something to do with Andy Rubin's startup, absorbed by Nothing back in 2021.
When I started using Essential Space, I assumed it was just another attempt to push AI in your face. But the Essential Key (a physical button on the left side) made me curious enough to give it a shot.
Pressing down the Essential Key once takes a screenshot of what's on your display, and then you are prompted to add typed notes about your current thought or press the record button for a voice note. Once recorded, press it once again to stop recording and then once again to save to Essential Space.
The intriguing part is how Essential Space digests and preps this data for recall. Currently, everything functions through the use of screenshots, but there are plans to integrate the camera with Essential Key to extract information from your surroundings for recall. There's also a focused mode planned for future release that will let you record an entire meeting. After this, the tool will not only recognise speakers and transcribe information; it will also create to-dos based on the conversation. With the current implementation, I often find myself taking screenshots of things I need to remember and leaving notes on them. The app generated useful summaries for each screenshot and also created to-dos automatically based on what's in the screenshot and the audio or text note it was tagged with.
The only downside of Essential Space is that you cannot take away your data. Hopefully, in the future, all of the data gathered by this feature will be available in files and folders backed up to the cloud, which can then be offloaded onto another OS if needed. Currently, I have find a folder that saves all the screenshots for Essential Space in the _Internal Storage > Pictures> EssentialSpace_ folder.
## Nothing Phone 3a Performance: Great, but far from the best
  * Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, 2.5GHz, 4nm
  * RAM - 8GB (LPDDR4X)
  * Storage - 128/256GB (UFS 2.2)


Everyday software performance is pretty smooth despite Nothing's rather controversial use of UFS 2.2 storage. The adaptive display panel smartly switches the refresh rate between 120-60Hz (depending on the screen brightness) when browsing through the software interface but is capped at 90Hz (or 90-60Hz) when opening native and third-party apps. Video and games are limited to 60Hz only.
Gaming performance was good, as I managed to run Call of Duty: Mobile at Very High graphics and frame rate. The display's touch sampling rate of 480Hz, which is only available in Game Mode, seemed just about sufficient. I've experienced better touch sensitivity, especially while playing games on competing devices.
The vapour chamber cooling system sure does its job of maintaining the phone's performance under stress
The phone warms up while playing games and gets hot when using the camera app outdoors; however, the camera app does not shut down nor show any warnings about limiting use. Indeed, the vapour cooling system was doing its job. However, the phone always struggled with processing images (it takes a second or two after capture), which is something I also noticed on the Realme P3 Pro (has the same chip). I also noticed some sluggishness when using the camera app, especially when switching between camera modes or switching cameras.
As far as benchmarks go, the Nothing Phone 3a performs as expected, as can be seen from the table below.

## Nothing Phone 3a Cameras: Well above average
  * Primary camera - 50-megapixel, OIS, f/1.5 aperture, AF
  * Ultrawide camera - 8-megapixel, f/2.2 aperture, FF
  * Telephoto camera - 50-megapixel, 2X, EIS, f/2.0 aperture, AF
  * Selfie camera - 32-megapixel, f/2.2 aperture, FF


 _Note: Our camera samples and observations are based on the latest software update (received around March 10), and it brought about some drastic camera improvements versus the previous update the phone was tested with. The update (Asteroids-V3.1-250302-1856-IND) also added several new features, including the ability to create and share new camera filters/presets mentioned below._
Nothing brought the widest selection of cameras available in this segment or price point. While most smartphones pack a wide + ultra-wide combination, Nothing has managed a 2X telephoto camera, which is an interesting addition given the price point.
In a recent update, Nothing even added the ability to create, share or import someone else's custom preset (via cube files), which is unique and could become popular in the Nothing community.
Another intriguing feature I like is the presets that can be applied when shooting. These presets are not just colour, hue, or saturation adjustments; they also define which camera mode (even video) and what magnification can be used when selected. You can also add advanced settings, like keeping the flash on, image quality (binned or full resolution), and even turning the grid on or off, which is brilliant! You can pin these presets to your home screen as a widget and launch directly into a particular custom preset.
Nothing Phone 3a ultrawide camera samples (tap images to expand)
Coming to the cameras, the ultra-wide camera is the weakest one of the three, but it is by no means bad. It offers decent performance for its price point, producing photos that are a bit low on detail but pack good dynamic range, ensuring enough detail in the darker areas. Lens barrel distortion is under control as well. Of course, all of this mainly applies to daylight shooting, as the results captured at night appear soft and look like paintings.
Nothing Phone 3a primary camera samples (tap images to expand)
The primary camera is indeed the best and most capable of the three. Unlike the Nothing Phone 3a, it's the only one with optical image stabilisation (OIS). Photographs captured in all shooting scenarios come out sharp and pack plenty of resolved detail. The primary camera also offers the best colour accuracy among the three, even though the photos appear a bit saturated compared to the actual scene.
Nothing Phone 3a 2X telephoto camera samples (tap images to expand)
The telephoto camera feeds on light. The colours it produces are a bit more saturated than the primary camera's; it also adds a bit of sharpening to images, which can appear excessive when shooting portrait photos. Provided there's good light, you get plenty of detail, and some crispy captures with good natural bokeh. The accuracy of edge detection varies depending on the complexity of your subject's hairstyle.
You begin to notice a drop in image quality under artificial light or when shooting against a source of light. When using portrait mode, the camera tries its best, but the absence of OIS does not allow it to pick up enough details from faces. Your subjects will also need to be perfectly still in such lighting conditions.
The telephoto camera performs better when not using the dedicated Portrait mode. 4X lossless samples are usable, but you will notice a drop in detail when you pixel peep. Despite its daylight capabilities, those who plan to use Portrait Mode often are indeed better off with the 's 3X telephoto camera, which is optically stabilised.
Selfies pack good detail and accurate edge detection in daylight but come out average in low light (tap image to expand)
Video recordings are indeed an area that Nothing needs to work on. For a low-end, mid-range smartphone, it meets expectations by offering good stabilisation and decent detail when shooting video at 1080p and 4K. However, this only applies when shooting in broad daylight, as low-light video capture is quite poor.
Consistency in terms of colour reproduction between the three cameras is something Nothing still needs to work on. Of course, we're discussing a Rs. 25,000 phone, but it would be great if Nothing could figure it out with future updates. All camera samples were clicked with the Auto-tone feature turned off, as it just added unnecessary colour saturation.
## Nothing Phone 3a Battery:
  * Battery capacity - 5,000mAh
  * Wired charging - 50W
  * Charger in the box - No


Despite having a slightly smaller battery than most competing smartphones, nothing has managed to squeeze the most out of it, thanks to good software optimisation. While the phone lasted me a whole day and a bit longer with heavy usage (calls, messaging, camera usage, and a bit of gaming), it managed a good score of 28 hours and 37 minutes, which is better than what the Realme P3 Pro' manages with a higher-capacity battery.
Our PCMark Work battery test, which replicates regular smartphone usage scenarios, running the battery down to 20 percent, lasted a solid 17 hours and 40 minutes of continuous usage. Again, the figure is a bit surprising, as the Realme P3 Pro, with the same chipset, an AMOLED display, and a larger 6,000mAh battery, managed 10 minutes less.
Charging speeds are relatively slow at 50W, given that most phones in this segment offer better. In our testing, we managed to charge the Nothing Phone 3a to 46 percent in 30 minutes and complete the charging process in 1 hour and 26 minutes when plugged into a 100W GaN charger. For comparison, Realme's P3 Pro charged a bigger 6,000mAh battery in 1 hour and 6 minutes.
### Nothing Phone 3a Verdict
With its focus on design and balanced hardware choices, Nothing certainly has come up with a winner in the mid-range (budget in global markets). It beautifully combines hardware, cosmetic design, and software. And it's even more applause-worthy, given that so much effort has been put into a low-end mid-ranger!
That said, the new camera hardware is an upgrade over the previous model. While it works alright, Nothing should work on delivering more camera updates to improve its performance even further.
Indeed, there are better performance-oriented alternatives like the (), and spec-heavy options like the () and the recently launched "flagship killer" () in India. But when it comes to design and software execution, Nothing's Phone 3a is a phone I can pick up and use when I get bored of other smartphones. It has the software that I want to use on every Android smartphone.

# OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite Review: New Display, Old Chipset
## How does the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite fare in the highly competitive sub-Rs. 20,000 price segment? | Updated: 24 June 2024 19:16 IST
OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite sports a refreshed design with a new camera island
Highlights
  * OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite runs on a Snapdragon 695 chipset
  * It packs a 5,500mAh battery that can be charged at 80W
  * The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite runs on Android 14-based ColorOS 14


has been launched in India as the successor to the Nord CE 3 Lite model that was launched last year. The new OnePlus Nord phone has a few upgrades in terms of specifications and features an updated design. The phone is the latest arrival in the highly competitive budget segment in India, where most smartphones are equipped with OLED screens, support 5G connectivity, and offer fast charging support. We've spent a few days with this smartphone to find out whether it offers enough to stand out in this segment.
## OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite price in India
OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite price in India starts at Rs. 19,999 for the 8GB+128GB RAM and storage configuration, while a 256GB storage variant is priced at Rs. 22,999. The phone is available in Mega Blue, Super Silver, and Ultra Orange colour options.
The company sent over the 8GB+256GB variant of the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite for review, and the handset comes along with a TPU case, an 80W SuperVOOC charging brick, a USB Type-A to Type-C charging cable, and a SIM ejector tool.
## OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite Review: Design
The ‘Mega Blue' colour variant of the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite has a plastic rear panel, and flat plastic edges that have a metal-like finish. The corners of the phone are slightly rounded and the flat edges help you get a comfortable grip. The handset feels slightly heavy, even without the included TPU case — it weighs 191g — but not enough to cause fatigue while using it.
The smooth rear panel is reflective and doesn't attract too many fingerprints or smudges
Like its predecessor, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite has a vertically aligned rear camera layout, but this year's model has a new pill-shaped section that surrounds the camera lenses that sits under the rear panel and also houses a dual LED flash setup.
The bottom edge of the Nord CE 4 Lite houses a 3.5mm audio jack, a microphone, a USB Type-C port and a speaker grille. There's an additional speaker on the top edge, while the power and volume buttons are located on the right side. The SIM card tray is located on the left edge of the handset. The phone has an IP54 rating, and the transparent cover also has inbuilt covers for the audio and charging ports on the phone.
## OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite Review: Specifications and software
In terms of specifications, there are two notable upgrades the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite delivers over its predecessor — an OLED display and a primary camera with optical image stabilisation. The smartphone has a 6.67-inch full-HD+ (1,080x2,400 pixels) AMOLED screen with up to 120Hz refresh rate. When automatic brightness is enabled, it goes up to 1,200 nits, which is higher than last year's model that featured an LCD screen.
You get the same Snapdragon 695 chipset on the Nord CE 4 Lite, which means OnePlus has used the same 6nm chip for the third year in a row in its Nord CE Lite series. The phone is equipped with 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM and up to 256GB of UFS 2.2 storage.
OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite offers a few features added by the company, but also some bloatware (tap to expand)
The phone boots Android 14 with the company's OxygenOS 14 skin on top. There's no word from OnePlus on the software support window for the handset, but its predecessor is scheduled to get two major Android version updates and an additional year of security updates.
OnePlus' new handset also offers the same connectivity options as the Nord CE 3 Lite, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1, 5G, 4G LTE, GPS, and a USB Type-C port. There's no support for contactless payments due to the lack of NFC connectivity.
The company has increased the size of the battery on the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite to 5,500mAh, and the charging rate has also been improved, with support for 80W SuperVOOC charging. Unlike the previous models, it also has an in-display fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication, thanks to the OLED screen.
## OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite: Performance
The Snapdragon 695 is a decent smartphone chip for ordinary tasks, and offers similar performance as its competitors that run on MediaTek's Dimensity 7050 chipset. It can run some popular games and several widely used apps, as long as they're not too demanding.
OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite benchmark results (tap to see larger image)
I played Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) and Asphalt 9 on the Nord CE 4 Lite. While the former ran well on the default graphics settings, there was a bit of lag in some scenarios when the phone got a little warm. On the other hand, Gameloft's Asphalt 9​​ ran smoothly without any issues, even after 30 minutes of gameplay.
I also ran some synthetic benchmark tests on the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and you can refer to the table below to see how it fares against two other handsets that are equipped with similar chipsets.
**Benchmark** | **OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite** | **Realme P1 5G** | **iQoo Z9 5G**
---|---|---|---
Geekbench 6 Single Core | 904 | 956 | 1151
Geekbench 6 Multi Core | 2015 | 2369 | 2669
AnTuTu v10 | 448,127 | 570,926 | 687,545
PCMark Work 3.0 | 9,850 | 13,319 | 13,319
3DMark Wild Life | 1508 | 4126 | 4126
3DMark Wild Life Unlimited | 1507 | 4205 | 4205
3DMark Sling Shot | 4226 | 6654 | 6654
3DMark Sling Shot Extreme | 3121 | 5766 | 5766
GFXBench Car Chase | 17 | 21 | 33
GFXBench Manhattan 3.1 | 30 | 39 | 60
GFXBench T-Rex | 60 | 60 | 108
I faced no issues with OxygenOS 14 on the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite in terms of stability. Apps remain in memory for a while after use, switching between apps is smooth (especially when using navigation gestures) and most apps can be loaded quickly.
Like other smartphones in the same price segment, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite comes with preinstalled bloatware, including Agoda, Bubble Pop, Netflix, Facebook, LinkedIn, Microsoft 365, Myntra, Tile Match, and Word Connect. I was able to uninstall all of these apps, which were present on the phone as soon as it was set up.
The AMOLED screen on the Nord CE 4 Lite is bright and a good upgrade over last year's model. OnePlus says the panel has a peak brightness of 1200 nits and it offered good visibility during the time I used the phone while outdoors, as long as automatic brightness was enabled.
The AMOLED screen on the Nord CE 4 Lite is a big improvement over its predecessor's LCD panel
Battery life on the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is on par with other smartphones in the same price segment. It lasted for 22 hours and 17 minutes in our HD video battery loop test, while averaging about 6 hours of screen on time, for a week. It takes about 30 minutes to charge the phone to 72 percent, while the phone is fully charged in about 55 minutes.
## OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite Review: Cameras
The OnePlus features a dual rear camera setup that includes a 50-megapixel shooter with a Sony LYT-600 sensor and an f/1.9 aperture, as well as a 2-megapixel depth sensor with an f/2.4 aperture. Practically speaking, the primary camera is the only one you can use to capture images.
While the Nord CE 4 Lite's primary camera has a lower megapixel count than the one on its predecessor. It's worth noting that the newest model offers support for optical image stabilisation (OIS) and electronic image stabilisation (EIS).
During the time I spent testing the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, the primary camera was able to capture clear images during the day, as long as the subject was not too far away. These images look decent enough for social media, but lack enough detail when you zoom in.

The Nord CE 4 Lite processes the colour of the sky differently in 1x and 2x modes (tap to expand)
The camera app also offers an in-sensor zoom mode which lets you capture images at 2x zoom. mode and the feature lets you capture detailed images of subjects that are close by. However, just like the default 1x mode, you'll notice a lack of detail when you zoom in on pictures.
The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite also comes with a dedicated Night mode, for shooting images in low light conditions. My biggest gripe with the camera app is that you need to manually enable the night mode — it won't automatically apply any enhancements when it detects a dark scenario.
When enabled, the night mode does deliver better results in terms of visibility and there's a little more detail compared to images shot in auto mode. However, it takes a little over a second to capture each image, which means that you can't use it to capture images of moving subjects. There's also a lot of smoothening to get rid of noise, and it also tends to make the sky appear much brighter than it actually is at night, which isn't ideal.

OnePlus has equipped the Nord CE 4 Lite with a 16-megapixel primary camera, which is good at capturing selfies while outdoors during the day — or even when indoors, assuming you have enough light around. However, images captured during the night are blurry and colours appear a little less vibrant.
You can capture videos at up to 1080p/ 30fps on the primary rear camera, at both 1x and 2x zoom, and both modes offer OIS and EIS support, with no option to turn it off. Videos are clear, and good enough for uploading to social media, but the OIS performance takes a bit of a hit in low light scenarios. The selfie camera lets you capture up to 1080p/30fps, but there's no stabilisation.
## OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite Review: Verdict
The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite brings upgrades over its predecessor (in terms of the display and primary rear camera) but it faces stiff competition in the under Rs. 20,000 segment, from other brands as well as its own models that offer better camera performance or a more powerful chipset. The company's older OnePlus Nord CE 3 has a more powerful processor and frequently drops under the Rs. 20,000 mark on Amazon.
As a result, it's hard to recommend the Nord CE 4 Lite, unless you're specifically looking to purchase a budget smartphone from OnePlus. There are several alternatives to the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite in the same price bracket. The Poco X6 5G and Realme 12+ both feature faster chips than the one that powers this handset, and have a more versatile set of cameras. Other options to consider include the iQoo Z9, Realme P1 Pro 5G, Vivo T3, and the Tecno Pova 6 Pro.

# Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review: An Affordable Edge 50?
## Going big on design and durability, Motorola’s mid-ranger does come up short in other areas.
Written by , Edited by | Updated: 12 August 2024 17:09 IST 
Snapchat Comment
The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is currently priced from Rs. 22,999 in India
Highlights
  * Motorola’s Edge 50 Fusion has an attractive and slim IP-rated design 
  * Performance is good for casual use and playing 3D games 
  * Battery life is a bit below expectations

Motorola has diversified its Edge 50 series quite a bit this year compared to last year's Edge 40 series. The company first launched its Edge 50 Pro (from Rs. 29,999), which was then followed by the launch of the Edge 50 Fusion (Rs. 22,999). Recently, it its Edge 50, which, at Rs. 27,999, seems to offer good value as well. Out of the three, the Edge 50 Pro is an easy high-end mid-range recommendation, provided you have the budget to spare. Sitting at the very bottom of the Edge 50 series is the Edge 50 Fusion. It's not as feature-packed as the other two, so is it still relevant after the launch of the Edge 50? And is it a good pick for those looking to buy their first mid-range smartphone?
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Design: Plenty to choose from
  * Dimensions - 162mm x 73.1mm x 7.9mm
  * Weight - 175g
  * Durability - IP68 (dust and water)


The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is the second phone to be launched in India as part of its mid-range Edge 50 series. The mid-range smartphone was launched alongside the premium Edge 50 Ultra. If there's one thing that's common among all smartphones in this series, it's their designs. While Motorola seems to have taken immense care in giving each phone enough individual attention (by going with different materials and textures), they all appear very similar when lined up.

The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion gets the same design treatment as the Edge 50 Pro and the newer Edge 50. There are rounded corners and curved edges with a 3D curved-edge display as well. At 175 grams, it is lighter than the other two as it does not have the wireless charging coil and capability.
However, as mentioned before, it's available in its own set of finishes. One of these, called Forest Blue, has a basic polycarbonate rear panel. The Hot Pink and Marshmallow Blue finishes come with vegan suede and vegan leather rear panels, respectively.
Whether you place the phone on a table or hold it in your hand while browsing, the vegan leather material (bonded to the rear panel) always ensures a solid grip. I also like how the cameras sit nearly flush with the rest of the rear panel. Motorola also includes a colour-matched, environmentally-friendly translucent case in the box, which can be attached for added protection.
The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion's cameras don't protrude as much as on other smartphones, making for a slim overall appearance
One of the finer points about the Edge 50 Fusion's design is its durability. The phone is IP68-rated for dust and water resistance, so you won't need to worry about it when taking it to the beach or poolside, as it can withstand submersion in sand and fresh water. What it misses out on is the rugged MIL-STD-810H certification which the Edge 50 gets.
While water damage is not usually covered under warranty, Motorola will provide some coverage provided the phone has not exceeded its IP68 claims (mentioned in its ), which is limited to immersion in up to 1.5 metres of fresh water for up to 30 minutes.
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Display: Could have been better
  * Display - 6.67-inch, 1080 x 2400 pixels, 144Hz
  * Display type - 3D curved, pOLED
  * Display Protection - Corning Gorilla Glass 5


The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a 3D curved edge display, which is mainly there for cosmetic reasons as the software does not take advantage of it. It has a slim border all-round that appears slightly thicker at the top and bottom. It gets the job done well in broad daylight with its 1,200 nits of brightness and also comes with Motorola's Aqua Touch feature that works just fine when used with wet hands. PWM/DC dimming is available even though it's just 720Hz.

The display does not have an HDR certification. But it shows a lot of colour banding (or gradients), especially when viewing dimly lit scenes. The phone supports Widevine L1 and, so you can stream movies and shows in full-HD quality.
Its high refresh rate seems a bit unnecessary keeping in mind that its hardware will rarely allow demanding 3D games anywhere near its peak performance (144Hz) and is so mainly used when browsing through the phone's software interface.
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Software: Nothing new to see
  * Software - Hello UI
  * Version - Android 14
  * Latest security patch - 1 May, 2024


Hello UI continues to add more bloatware (native apps) to what still appears to be a very clean and customisable operating system. It's based on Android 14, but this is not the near-stock operating system we know and loved half a decade ago. You do get two preinstalled apps - Facebook and Netflix and these can be uninstalled if not needed. The native weather app shows a lot of ads, which is a first for a mid-range smartphone.
Motorola seems to be adding quite a bit of bloatware on its phones lately
The phone is not as big on AI-enabled features as the we earlier. And most of these ”AI features” like Magic Eraser, Unblur and Best Take come courtesy of Google's apps and are not exclusive to Motorola.
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Performance: Meets expectations
  * Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2
  * RAM - 8/12GB LPDDR4X
  * Storage - 128/256GB UFS 2.2


The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion's processor does a good job of keeping up with daily multi-tasking requirements. Apps also remain in memory, so there are fewer app restarts. There's virtually no lag or stuttering when interacting with Hello UI, which should be the case given that this is a mid-range smartphone.
Raw performance is as expected and on par with the competition. This is unless you compare it with the which has a high-end MediaTek Dimensity 8300 Ultra processor, aimed at the gaming crowd.

Audio quality, thanks to Dolby Atmos, sounds loud, clear and immersive. This also works well while playing games.
As for the gaming experience, I found the processor to be capable of running titles like Call of Duty: Mobile (CODM) and Asphalt Legends Unite with no problems with default settings. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion supports a maximum of High graphics and a maximum frame rate in CODM. While playing CODM, the phone does get hot after a short while because it lacks a cooling mechanism (also why it's so slim and light). It heats up even more when using the camera app. But this heat is mainly felt on the display rather than the rear panel. Still, performance-wise, the phone is quite stable with no noticeable drop even with sustained loads.
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Cameras: Needs a lot of work
  * Main camera - 50-megapixel (OIS), f/1.9 aperture, AF
  * Ultra-wide camera - 13-megapixel, f/2.2 aperture, AF
  * Selfie camera - 32-megapixel, f/2.5 aperture, FF


I had big expectations from the primary camera, given that it's backed by Sony's newer LYTIA 700C sensor. But the results were far from impressive, given that this is a mid-range device.

The primary camera manages decent image quality with photos that appear overprocessed in the HDR department. The backgrounds like clouds, appear exaggerated and absolutely don't resemble the actual scene. The foreground will either be underexposed or overexposed with super-saturated colours (greens and blues) that almost appear like an Instagram filter. Textures and details on objects and surfaces aren't the best I've seen in this segment. In low light, the dedicated Night mode produced sharper images with better-looking textures.

The ultra-wide angle camera is worse and has plenty of purple fringing and clipped highlights. Despite packing autofocus, the images don't appear sharp but soft in general. In low light, photos appeared a bit blurry and soft and were mostly not usable.

Selfies captured in daylight appear sharp and pack plenty of detail but with reddish and oversaturated skin tones. Edge detection is decent as well. Low-light selfies are just about passable with or without activating the auto-screen flash. I also came across some random situations when shooting in daylight where the selfie camera only processed the bright background, leaving the subject in the dark (like a shadow).

Video recordings at 1080p appear a bit too scaled down with low detail and lack basic clarity apart from the clipped highlights. The 4K video, which can only be captured at 30fps, appeared leagues better (at the cost of more space), but again, with a lot of clipped highlights showcasing the lack of decent dynamic range.
## Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Battery: A bit underwhelming
  * Battery capacity - 5,000mAh
  * Charging rate - 68W
  * Charger in the box - Yes


While 5,000mAh batteries aren't really a problem, we are beginning to see bigger batteries make it into competing smartphones in this segment. Among these is the OnePlus CE 4, which did a phenomenal job in our battery life test, lasting a whopping 32 hours and 21 minutes. Motorola Edge 50 Fusion fares well, but just not as good, managing 24 hours and 24 minutes.

In daily use, the phone managed to last a day and a half with casual use but required to be plugged in at the end of the day with heavy usage. Charging the phone was fairly quick. The packaged charger managed to fully charge the phone in 46 minutes in normal mode and 36 minutes in the faster Charge boost mode.
### Motorola Edge 50 Fusion Review Verdict
Motorola may have found a good match of style, durability, hardware and software, but it did not spend much time refining it. This is how we have what appears to be an unfinished product which is evidently visible upon launching the camera app or when watching video. Lacklustre camera performance aside, battery life isn't as good as some competitors. The same can be said about its raw performance, which is why we won't see this phone being a hit with the gaming crowd as well.
The Motorola Edge 50 (Rs. 27,999 onwards), on the other hand, goes the extra mile, offering even better durability, wireless charging and a telephoto camera at a slightly higher price tag… on paper. Meanwhile, the (), while treading a thin line, managed to cover more bases and blew us away with its battery life. If you have gaming and raw performance on your mind, the () is a much better choice at the same price point. If all you are looking for is an IP68 rating, then Redmi's Note And this leaves the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion with few takers who value durability and style over substance.
